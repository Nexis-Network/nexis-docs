Nexis Network is a web3 infrastructure protocol with the mission of being the go to
blockchain solution for enterprises, Web3 gaming, and DeFi. It provides infinite
scalability through zkSnarks, optimistic roll-ups, side-chains, decentralized and
automated yield generating bridges, smart contract auditing and verification systems,
and other features. Nexis Network also has multiple target markets including Decentralized
Finance, Enterprise Solutions, Web3 and Big Data. Its goal is to offer developers
easy access to major scaling and infrastructure solutions while maintaining a solid
foundation for growth and security excellence.

## Nexis Network is

- Cross-chain interoperable
- Decentralized
- Eco-friendly
- open-source
- Permissionless

## Nexis Network is

- Scale Web3 adoption and security
- Foster participation and growth
- Encourage application development
- Cultivate a strong developer ecosystem



## Speed

Nexis Network achieves transaction finality in ~2 seconds on average and provides real-time transactions. That aid in enhancing metaverse gaming, data processing, transaction processing, and cross-chain transactions.

## Scalability

Nexis Network can process thousands of transactions per seconds and can scale to hundreds of nodes with the capability of scaling to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS).

## Security

PoS BFT consensus provides institutional-grade security to distributed networks. Nexis Network offers absolute finality, which means that transactions can never be reverted like in networks with probabilistic finality.

The Nexis Network is also leaderless. By removing leaders, security doesnâ€™t rely on a small set of actors or node validators.

## Smart Contract Support

Nexis Network is fully compatible with Ethereum. Developers can create and deploy smart contracts as they would on Ethereum using custom smart contracts or their favorite open-source protocols.



## Securing the network

A node validator must stake 10,000 NZT tokens to be able to operate as a node validator, which provides early adopters the benefit of a low barrier to entry for validating transactions and helping secure the Nexis Network as the fair launch price of Nexis (NZT) was $0.05.

## Governance

The NZT token will hold a utility of governance voting rights for NZT token burns throughout the years from the treasury smart contract. This is due to helping prevent inflation and keeping a stable and secure price target for securing the Nexis Network blockchain.
Voting will consist of the following discussion topics

- Grant funding for new projects (DeFi, Gaming, Security, Government compliance tools, and more).
- Projects being listed on the Nexis Network decentralized exchange (DEX).
- NZT token burning events.

## Node Validator Incentives

NZT transaction emissions are distributed as incentives for securing and scaling the network. These incentives go directly to node validators to encourage competition, and improve the health of the Nexis Network ecosystem.
