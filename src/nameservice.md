# Nexis Names Service

Nexis Names is a decentralized naming system built on the Nexis network. It provides human-readable names to blockchain addresses, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps), similar to domain names on the internet. Nexis Names make it easier for users to interact with the Nexis network by replacing complex addresses with simple and memorable names. Nexis Names is accessible [here](https://names.nexis.network)

## Components of Nexis Names

1. **Smart Contracts:** Nexis Names uses a set of smart contracts deployed on the Nexis blockchain. These contracts manage the registration, resolution, and management of names.

2. **Subgraph:** The Nexis Names subgraph is a tool used to index and query data from the Nexis blockchain related to names and their associated addresses. It provides a convenient way for frontend applications to access name data.

3. **Node:** Nodes on the Nexis network play a crucial role in the resolution of Nexis Names. They receive and process queries for name resolution, ensuring that the correct address is returned for a given name.

4. **Frontend:** The frontend of Nexis Names refers to the user interface that interacts with the smart contracts and subgraph. It allows users to register and manage names, as well as resolve names to addresses.

## How Nexis Names Works

1. **Registration:** Users can register a name through the Nexis Names frontend by interacting with the smart contracts. The registration process involves selecting a name and linking it to a blockchain address or resource.

2. **Resolution:** When someone wants to interact with a registered name, the Nexis Names frontend queries the subgraph or node to resolve the name to its associated address. This allows users to send transactions to human-readable names.

3. **Management:** Name owners can manage their names through the Nexis Names frontend. They can update the associated address, set up subdomains, and transfer ownership of the name.

## Benefits of Nexis Names

- **User-Friendly:** Nexis Names provides human-readable names that are easier to remember and share than complex blockchain addresses.
- **Decentralized:** Nexis Names is built on the Nexis network, ensuring decentralization and censorship resistance.
- **Interoperability:** Nexis Names can be used across different applications and services on the Nexis network, making it easier to interact with decentralized services.

In conclusion, Nexis Names is a critical component of the Nexis network, providing a user-friendly and decentralized naming system for blockchain addresses and resources.
