# Names Services

Nexis Names is a decentralized naming system built on the Nexis network. It provides human-readable names to blockchain addresses, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps), similar to domain names on the internet. Nexis Names make it easier for users to interact with the Nexis network by replacing complex addresses with simple and memorable names.

## How Nexis Names Works

1. **Registration:** Users can register a name on the Nexis Names system by interacting with the Nexis Names smart contract. Once registered, the name is linked to a specific blockchain address or resource.

2. **Resolution:** When someone wants to interact with a registered name, the Nexis Names resolver is used to resolve the name to its associated blockchain address or resource. This allows users to send transactions to human-readable names instead of complex addresses.

3. **Management:** Name owners can manage their names through the Nexis Names smart contract. They can update the associated address, set up subdomains, and transfer ownership of the name.

## Benefits of Nexis Names

- **Human-Readable Names:** Nexis Names provide human-readable names that are easier to remember and share than complex blockchain addresses.
- **Decentralization:** Nexis Names is built on the Nexis network, ensuring decentralization and censorship resistance.
- **Interoperability:** Nexis Names can be used across different applications and services on the Nexis network, making it easier to interact with decentralized services.

In conclusion, Nexis Names is a crucial component of the Nexis network, providing a user-friendly and decentralized naming system for blockchain addresses and resources.
